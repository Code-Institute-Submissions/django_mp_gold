## Milestone Project Gold

# Motivation
_I created this project to allow users to make purchases through the webiste. For a good user experience I wanted to allow the user to 
create an account, reset password, login, logout, add items to the cart and then checkout. I chose to use a very simplistic approach so 
it was easy to navigate around._     

# Naming And inspiration

I chose this name due to the software name given my many companies to the software update they release, gold meaning the final version as this 
is my final project. To me this was the best name I could of given as this being my last project I went "milestoneprojectgold"_


### Navigation Bar
_For my page I wanted to keep a simple feel to the website so I placed the title to the left, and on the right hand side went with links
as I feel most websites user have been on have links placed on this side. I felt this would users a familarity when navigating through my website.
The colour scheme I chose goes really well as its a bright orange and the black background combines with it quite well._

## Credits
_This is a project which was created only for a project purpose and the images have been used which all credits go microsoft xbox and sony
playstation. I do not take credit for any of the content and the content was just used as I wanted to create console gift card website
where the user can make purchases.

## Backgrounds

_For my final project I trialled a number of backgrounds but I decided to go with a black background as I felt it would work well with
 the orange I chose for the navigation bar. The colours were difficult because I wanted a gaming site feel and at the same time I did not
 want to use a blue or green because those colours are associated with the xbox and playstation. In the end I went with a black background
 as the white boxes which the gift card names and descriptions are included in. The white boxes really stand out with the black colour, giving
 my site a really strong colour scheme for the user to experience as they are navigation around. I did have diffiuclty with this, as normally
 any changes made to my css file would show up. On this occasion when ever I made a change I had to enter the code python3 manage.py collectstatic
into the terminal so it would save the changes made, then python3 manage.py runserver so I can view the changes on the developmental server.


# Technologies

#### HTML

_This was used to create a structure for my page, which I could build on to later using css
to add colour and styling to the page (see below)._

#### CSS

_I used css style sheet which is a file that basically includes all my styles that add sytling, 
images, fonts etc. to the page. The css used on here gave my page styling as you see in the border style
I have used at start of my page._
